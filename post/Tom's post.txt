Shortly after Everett's well-received remarks, Lincoln spoke for only a few minutes.[17] With a "few appropriate remarks", he was able to summarize his view of the war in just ten sentences.
Despite the historical significance of Lincoln's speech, modern scholars disagree as to its exact wording, and contemporary transcriptions published in newspaper accounts of the event and even handwritten copies by Lincoln himself differ in their wording, punctuation, and structure.[18][19] Of these versions, the Bliss version, written well after the speech as a favor for a friend, is viewed by many as the standard text.[20] Its text differs, however, from the written versions prepared by Lincoln before and after his speech. It is the only version to which Lincoln affixed his signature, and the last he is known to have written.[20]
