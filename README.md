*e.g:*

*Abrarham Lincoln*
*Civil War; USA;*
*Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.*
*Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.*
*But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate¡ªwe can not consecrate¡ªwe can not hallow¡ªthis ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us¡ªthat from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion¡ªthat we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain¡ªthat this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom¡ªand that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.*

## The programming standard
1. Please use meaningful variable name, class name and function name. Never use stupid name such as "a = 1" or "def qwert():".
2. Please obey camel-case naming method. Use lower camel case for variable (e.g. userName, lowerCamelCase). Use upper camel case for class and function name (e.g. IsFriend, DirectReport).
3. Please program in separate file and we will combine them when finishing.
4. Please add your name and update date in each file, which can show your contribution.
5. Please use function and save each function required as a single .py file, we will combine them later.
